== Session Hell

If anyone has a clue on how to do this I'd be very grateful.

Within one Rails app I want to have:
* domain-testing.com and test.domain-testing.com share a session
* domain-testing-alt.com to have it's own session

So far I can get 
* all three urls to have their own session (comment/uncomment line 42 in environment.rb)
OR
* domain-testing.com and test.domain-testing.com share a session but domain-testing-alt.com doesn't hold it's session between page loads

I thing I just need to be able to set something like 

config.action_controller.session = {:domain => ".domain-testing.com"}

in a before_filter in application_controller.  I haven't been able to figure this out yet.

It seems like, looking at ActionController::Session::CookieStore that, once initialized the objects are frozen.

This is on Rails 2.3.3 on Ruby 1.8.7 

Anyone have any ideas?

To get some play code just do a 
git clone git@github.com:wiseleyb/session-domain-hell.git

Add this to your /etc/hosts file:

127.0.0.1                               domain-testing.com
127.0.0.1                               test.domain-testing.com
127.0.0.1                               domain-testing-alt.com

Flush your cache: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache  (or, on 10.4 sudo lookupd -flushcache)

Fire it up (script/server)

Look at the header on the pages domain-testing.com:3000, test.domain-testing.com, domain-testing-alt.com

Clicking Login - just sets a name that appears in the header and is stored in a session.  Logging out clears that.

Ideally domain-testing.com and test.domain-testing.com share a session.  domain-testing-alt.com has it's own session.
